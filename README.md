# Fingerprint-Attendance-System-IOT-
fingerprint attendance system with using Arduino circuit and IOT concepts
The most common use of this system is to manage students attendance in school & collages. Traditionally faculties take attendance manually and manages records on paper. This process is very time consuming, non- user friendly and tedious .To resolve mentioned issues, we are developing a fingerprint attendance system to help faculty members, in this project, many of the processes areautomatedwhich perform activities like progress report of the student. This will result in more free time for faculty which can be spend improving student skill development & co-curricular activities.
Fingerprint identification is one of the most well known and common biometric identification systemBecause of their uniqueness & consistency over time. The record of the fingerprints of various students and other information will be maintained in a database. The communication between the pc and module was done by ARDUINO REV3 (clone) circuit.

For controlling both these modules the microcontroller board, ARDUINO REV3 (clone).
GUI: Microsoft Visual Basic .Net 2013./ python
Database: MS Access.
